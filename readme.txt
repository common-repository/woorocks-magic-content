Magic Content by WooRocks is a lightweight and powerful add-on that allows you to take control of your websiteâ€™s content by
restricting access to sections to logged in users, specific user roles or to logged out users.

You don't have to use any kind of shortcodes using this plugin. Just install Elementor Page Builder and this plugin and you are all set.

*   Choose if a section will be visible for logged in / logged out users only.
*   Choose if a section will be visible for logged in users that are members of a choosen role in Wordpress.
*   Choose if a section will be visible for logged in users that are members of any custom role in Wordpress.
*   Choose if a section will be visible for users from a specific country with two letter countrycodes.
*   Choose if a section will be visible for users from a specific region.
*   Choose if a section will be visible for users from a specific city.
*   You can NOT combine countries like SE, NO in this version.

You will have to assign sections both country and region or country or city if using GEO locations for them to work properly!

This is the first version of the plugin and we will add more features to it soon. The more people that uses it and spreads the word
about it the more time we will invest in developing it further.

We are also working on a PRO version fully packed with other features for the Elementor Page Builder Plugin.

1. Upload the plugin files to the `/wp-content/plugins/woorocks-magic-content` directory, or install the plugin through the WordPress plugins screen directly.
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' screen in WordPress
3. Startup the Elementor Page Builder and edit a page.
4. Goto a section and click on the Advanced TAB and see the Magic Content controls.
